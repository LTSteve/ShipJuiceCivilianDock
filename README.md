# ShipJuiceCivilianDock

About:
This project is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that gives the player a method of getting resources into orbit without having to launch the resources themselves.

This mod should support any resource mods that you may want to use.

Features:
- Civilian Docking Port: a part that intakes resources at the cost of credits when it is active in a Kerbin orbit.
- Adjustable Difficulty: you can adjust the period at which resources are transported (in days), the amount of resources transported, and the cost overhead percent to ship the resources to your station.

Planned Features:
- A ground 'export' part that can be placed on celestial bodies other than Kerbin
	- limitations on what can be shipped from bodies other than Kerbin based on available resources
	- (possibly in another mod) limitations on what can be shipped from bodies other than Kerbin based on outpost happiness (or something)
- A custom model for the civilian dock so it doesn't look so terrible

Installation:
Just chuck the ShipJuice folder into KerbalSpaceProgram/GameData

Mods that go well with this one:

- Extraplanetary Launchpads: Ship parts up to your orbital construction facility without having to launch/mine/recycle/refine them!
- Kerbal Construction Time: The time it takes to build ships means more when your budget is slowly being drained getting resources into orbit.
